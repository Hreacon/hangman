# Hangman

#### This application lets you play hangman, 1.28.2016

#### By Nicholas Jensen-Hay and Mary Warrington

## Description

Hangman presents the user with a random word, blanked out to not show any letters, and then lets them choose letters. When they choose a letter that the word contains, it is revealed! If they choose a letter not contained in the word, the hangman gains body parts. When the hangman is complete (with six bodyparts), they lose the game. If they guess the word in its entirety, they win!
